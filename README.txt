COMPILING AND RUNNING CODE:
To compile and run, cd into the folder and type make. The executable can be run with up to two parameters: ./a3 r 0.04. The first parameter should either be 'e', 't', or 'r', which picks the solver, either Euler, Trapezoidal, or RK4 respectively. The second should be a number specifying the stepsize used by the solver.

In the simulation, pressing 's' will toggle drawing the springs between the particles if there are any (there are no springs in the SimpleSystem). Pressing '1' will show the SimpleSystem, '2' will show the PendulumSystem with 4 particles, and '3' will show the ClothSystem with 8x8 particles.

For the ClothSystem, pressing the up or down arrow keys to move the cloth back and forth!

COLLABORATION:
Worked and collaborated with Lili Sun and Manting Lao.

KNOWN PROBLEMS:
Not sure about any problems in the code right now.

EXTRA CREDIT:
Did not do any extra credit.

COMMENTS:
Was really cool how the springs in the cloth worked together to maintain its shape!
